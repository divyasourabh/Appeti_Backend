                <h5>1. RASGULLA</h5>
                <p>It is Bengal's endowment to the world and demands absolutely no introduction. These spongy-soft round mishtis, soaked in sugar syrup, have become an icon of Bengali cuisine. K C Das' name is considered synonymous with Rasgulla /Rosogolla / Rashogulla etc. No matter how much the name gets mispronounced, the taste remains the same! It would not have happened without Late Nabin Chandra Das. Late N.C. Das is considered to be the Steve Jobs of Rasgulla; he is to the confectionary what Steve Jobs was to the Smartphone. </p>
                <p>K.C. Das, an establishment by Nobin Chandra Das' grandson, has since then been the torchbearer of the Kolkata's Rasgulla. K.C. Das' Rasgulla has attained an iconic status all over the world with their canned Rasgullas. Couple of other ambrosial variants available are BakedRosgulla, Notun Gurer Rosgulla, which mostly pertains to exist during the winter season. The real fun of the Rasgulla is to have it straight out of the earthen bowl, at one go, and lick the sticky syrup that drips down your lips. It leaves you craving for them even if you are far away from the city. </p>
                
                <h5>2. MISHTI DOI</h5>

It now has some well-liked variants like bhapa doi(steamed yoghurt), lal doi (sweetened yoghurt red in colour), aam doi(alphanso mango yoghurt), Tulsi Doi(mishti doi containing extracts of tulsi herb).

                <h5>5. KHEERKADAM</h5>
                <p>Kheer Kadam, also known as Raskadam is a two-in-one euphoric experience combining two different kinds of sweets. The name of the sweet comes from the local Kadamba flower which explains its appearance. While the core is made of a harder and dryer version of the Rosogolla, what sets this sweet apart is the outer casing made of milk solids or Kheer. It is indeed one of the exceptionally in-demand delights. 
Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, is an iconic sweet shop that's famous for its exotic creations with mishti.

                <h5>6. MIHIDANA</h5>
                <p>Mihidana, the micro counterpart of the traditional Boondi, is derived from two words, Mihi-meaning fine, and Dana- meaning grain. This dessert is made from powdered Kaminibhog, Gobindabhog and basmati rice, mixed with a small amount of gram flour and saffron for a golden colour. It is then blended with water by hand till its colour lightens. This mix is then poured through a brass ladle with tiny holes into a pot of ghee and deep-fried. The fine fried small rice-like grains are dipped in sugar syrup and drained once soaked. Ganguram & Sons Sweets is one of the premium sweet meat shops to make delicious Mihidana. This venerable sweet meat shop was set up in 1885 serves both traditional Bengali sweets and innovative variations based on old favourites. Ganguram Sweets has built up a loyal following amongst Kolkatans. In particular, locals come here for their amazingly made Mihidana, which is often cited as the best in Kolkata</p>
                
                <h5>7. SITA BHOG</h5>
                <p>To a layman it appears as a bowl of sweet white rice accompanied with miniature gulab jaamun pieces, but there' s more than what meets the eye and definitely the palate. A myth about this sweet's name is that this Sweet is one of the favorite sweet of Mata Sita. Mouchak is known for all the traditional sweets in Kolkata, hence legendary for the product "Sita Bhog".

Bhim Chandra Nag, the true specialty of West Bengal is confectioneries and desserts. There are numerous dilemmas regarding the nomenclature of this "mishti". According to some, in 1856, on the occasion of the arrival of Lady Canning to Calcutta, Bhim Nag confectioners was trusted the responsibility of creating a new mishti for her, while according to others, Lady Canning loved to eat this sweet—hence the name. It is akin to the pan-Indian Gulab Jamun, of course, with its own sweet twist that we heart! A must-have dish it is!
</p>
                
                <h5>9. DARBESH</h5>
                <p>"Darbesh" is a popular and classical Bengali sweet which is a lookalike of Boondi Laddu but different taste wise. One of the main ingredients of Darbesh is Khowa / Mawa while we don't add Khowa in Boondi Laddu. They are prepared in a lot of Bengali households and relished by all. Sen Mahasay, a shop most renowned for Darbesh, amongst many other things, has its history going back to 1897.

                <h5>10. KALO JAAM</h5>
                <p>Kalo Jaam or Kala Jamun is Gulab Jamun's younger sibling which is made of paneer and khoya. Bearing a resemblance to the famous Gulab Jamun, the distinct taste is what sets this dessert apart. Kalo Jaam balls are deep-fried until a hint of black is seen on the outer coating. They are then soaked in thick sugar syrup for two hours and served coated with milk powder.Deshbandhu Mishtanna brings to you the best of Kalo Jaams in this city.
