									You're a doer. You love entrepreneurship and bringing people together. You roll up your sleeves and you do what's needed because you want to build something awesome. Twitter, Facebook, Quora, etc. aren't just passing social media trends, they are community building tools. And you've already spent a ton of time on each them. You teach your friends how to use them, convince them why they are important and would be teaching us a thing or two about them. You probably have more followers than we do. You're obsessed with entrepreneurship. Not because it's #trending, but because you see it as a platform for innovation, learning and building. You can make sense out of chaos. You're organized. You pay extra attention to details because you know they matter. Some people may even tease you for it. We won't! Spreadsheets, calendars and life hacks are your best friend. You're passionate and purposeful. This doesn't mean you're not creative or one step ahead. You anticipate what is needed next and do it before it's asked. You're constantly thinking of new ideas AND able to execute on them.
