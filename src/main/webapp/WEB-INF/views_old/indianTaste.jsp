							<p>
								<strong>North India</strong>: Punjab, UP, Harayana, J&amp;K
							</p>
							<p>
								The land of the Pajis and the Jats, the land of Dal Lake and the
								Ganga, the land of beautiful hills and verdant valleys-the North
								offers a smorgasbord of contrasts and magnificence. While
								Punjab, the Land of Five Rivers, ushers in images of the Golden
								Temple, the feast of Langar, Bhangra, folk tales of Heer Ranja
								and of course,&nbsp;<em>makki di roti</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>rajma-chawal</em>,
								it is its people's large hearts and hospitality that stays with
								you. Jammu and Kashmir will forever be etched in our hearts as
								the place where a flower-laden shikharas meander on the Dal
								Lake, where Chakri (traditional music) and Roof (traditional
								dance performed by boys) are enjoyed in abundance, where one can
								sip on Noon or Sheer Chai (salty or sweet tea), enjoy mutton in
								all its glory and taste flaky breads like the sheermal and tsot.
								The Hindi heartland of India, UP presents a varied topography
								with an emphasis on literature, music and dance. Home to the
								famous Kumbh Mela, Uttar Pradesh is an absolute delight when it
								comes to food, offering everything from Lucknowi chaat to
								Banarasi paan. One of the wealthiest states of India, both in
								terms of GDP and history, Haryana has made its place in the
								Indian subcontinent as a hub for IT and automotive industries.
								Full of gusto, its people celebrate festivals with fanfare and,
								like the rest of the North, place great emphasis on good food.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>South India</strong>: Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala,
								Tamil Nadu
							</p>
							<p>Presenting a unique way of life so dissimilar from each
								other yet so evocatively southern, states like Karnataka,
								Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are known for
								their temples and traditions in equal measure. The
								fire-worshipping devotees of Tamil Nadu meld with its IT
								culture, its mellifluous music of nagasvara and tavil is as
								harmonic as its curry leaves and mustard in dishes like tamarind
								rice and sweet pongal. Known for its coconut, tea, coffee,
								cashew and spices, Kerala is a haven on the Malabar coast and
								famous for its Post Colonial architecture, fisheries and temple
								festivals like Thrissur Pooram as it is for its cuisine, which
								includes lovely seafood among other delicacies. The birthplace
								of some of the most formidable empires of ancient India,
								Karnataka is home to amazing Kannad authors and musicians of the
								Carnatic tradition, both of which are known the world over. Its
								Mysore style paintings are as legendary as its sweet offerings
								like Mysore pak and Dharwad pedha!</p>
							<p>
								<b>West India: </b>Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan
							</p>
							<p>From the stark yet colourful landscape of desert and sand
								dunes to the Western Ghats full of lush greenery, Western India
								encompasses myriad cultures and traditions. Though language and
								geography divide the West, what unites the region is a common
								love for epicurean delights. If the desert region of Rajasthan
								lends itself to erstwhile palaces, Manganiyar musicians,
								Kalbeliya dancers with their many-coloured skirts and of course
								ghewar and ghee-laden sweets, Gujarat, the Jewel of West India,
								is known for its well-developed infrastructure, chaniya choli
								and garba and of course its mouth-watering farsan. The land of
								'Mi Maratha' holds its own with its prevalence of Bollywood, its
								port culture, its Ellora caves, its Natya Sangeet and its unique
								food from the ubiquitous solkadi to the lovely Bhakhri as well
								as delicious pickles and condiments. West India, in its
								many-flavored splendor truly caters to diverse palettes-from
								spicy to sweet, from crunchy to doughy, and everything in
								between-and that is the beauty of it.</p>
